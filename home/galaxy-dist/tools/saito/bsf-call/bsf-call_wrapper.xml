**ComMet**

Detection of differentially methylated regions from bisulfite-seq mapping data

------

**Input format**

hogehoge

------

**Output format**

output1 contains information of differential methylation at individual cytosine sites::
  
  Col.| Description
  ----+--------------------------------------
  1   | chromosome name 
  2   | 0-based genomic position
  3   | mC ratio in sample1
  4   | mC ratio in sample2 
  5   | prob. for hypermethylation (UP) in sample1 against sample2
  6   | prob. for hypomethylation (DOWN) in sample1 against sample2
  7   | prob. for no methylation change (NoCh) between sample1 and sample2


output2 contains information of detected DMRs::
  
  Col.| Description
  ----+--------------------------------------
  1   | chromosome name 
  2   | 0-based genomic start position
  3   | 0-based genomic stop position
  4   | direction of differential methylation (UP/DOWN) comparing sample1 to sample2
  5   | log-likelihood ratio score 
  6   | log-likelihood ratio score divided by DMR length


Make sure output1 and output2 are used properly considering the purpose of your study. 
You should use output1 if you are interested only in differential methylation at 
individual cytosine sites (Note that it is the purpose of most existing packages for 
bisulfite sequencing data analysis developed by other groups).
ComMet is mainly designed for DMR detection, i.e. determining precise boundaries of 
regional differential methylation, even if DMRs include some cytosine sites whose 
observed methylation changes are relatively weak due to limited sequencing depth. 
Such an analysis is useful for identifying biologically important DMRs such as 
cis regulatory elements; output2 is suitable for this purpose.

**Tips for detection of DMRs in non-CpG context**

ComMet version 1.1 supports detection of DMRs in non-CPG context (CHG and CHH). 

Make sure an input file is prepared separately for each context, and ComMet is executed 
with proper options. We do not recommend that input files for different contexts are 
combined, or ComMet is executed --noncpg option while an input file contains only CpGs.

**FAQ**

\Q. What is the meaning of the error "distance between neighbor CpGs must not be less than 2"?
::
  
  A. 
  Your input file contains invalid genomic positions. 
  By definition of CpG, the base next to C must be G, and therefore two neighbor CpGs should be 
  separated by at least two bases. Your input file may violate this rule for several reasons.  
  First, the input file may contain two neighbor CpGs from different strands, 
  i.e. the 5'-CpG-3' in the plus strand, and the neighboring 3'-GpC-5' in the minus strand. 
  See the "Input format" section above for this issue. 
  Second, the input file may contain cytosines in non-CpG context; just remove them. 

  
\Q. The read counts in the example input file are decimals rather than integers. Why?  
::
  
  A. 
  Either decimals or integers can be used for read counts in input files. 
  The reason that the example input file contains decimals is that some alignment tools produce 
  probability-weighted read counts. Of course, you can use your favorite aligners for preparing 
  input files that may contain integers only.


\Q. Can ComMet compute statistical significance (p-values) rather than likelihood ratio scores?
::

  A.
  No. But we are planning to address this issue in the next version of ComMet.
